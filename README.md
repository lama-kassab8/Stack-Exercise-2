# Infix to Postfix Converter (Array + Linked List Stack)

This Python project converts infix expressions like: ( 1 + 2 ) * 3 into their postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) form: 1 2 + 3 *

I implemented this solution **two ways**:
1. Using a **Python list** as a stack
2. Using a **custom stack implemented with a linked list** â€” to understand the underlying mechanics of stack operations.

##  What's Included

-  `infixToPostfix()` using a **Python list**
-  `infixToPostfix()` using a **stack built with a singly linked list**
-  `Node` and `StackLinkedList` classes
